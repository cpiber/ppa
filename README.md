# PPA

This is the source repository for my [ppa](https://launchpad.net/~cppiber/+archive/ubuntu/ppa)

## Building packages

Please refer to `build.md`. Please note that all commands mentioned are expected to be executed in the root directory of this repo, on the corresponding branch.

`pdebuild` will create package-specific files one level up, so it is recommended to clone the repository into a subfolder.
