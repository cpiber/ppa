Description: Icarus verilog compiler
  Icarus Verilog is intended to compile all of the Verilog HDL as
  described in the IEEE-1364 standard. It is not quite there
  yet. It does currently handle a mix of structural and behavioral
  constructs.
  .
  The compiler can target either simulation, or netlist (EDIF).
